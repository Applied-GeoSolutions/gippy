v1.1.0
- License changed from GPL v2 to Apache 2.0
- Added test framework
- Separated into python modules: gippy (core), gippy.tests, gippy.algorithms
- Cleaned up setup to use single 'gippy' distro directory
- Refactored: new base class GeoResource (linked to GDALMajorObject)
- Chunking code moved from GeoData to new ChunkSet class
- Removed 'chunking by chunk index' feature (poor implementation made it error prone)
- Added interpolation option to CookieCutter
- Added Resolution convenience function to GeoResource (gets resolution from Affine)
- Added SpectralCovariance and RXD (RX Anomoly detector) to algorithms

v1.0.4
- Added Affine to get affine transformation for SRS
- Python bindings now correctly handling Point data type (returned as tuple)

v1.0.3
- Changed name of secondary probability image in fmask algorithm to -prob (from _prob)
- Suppressed stderr messages from GDAL (these should all be handled internally by GIPPY)

v1.0.2
- Fixed bug in Indices algorithm

v1.0.1
- Added SpectralStatistics algorithm and functions to GeoImage and GeoAlgorithms
- Added additional gdal helper functions
- Additional chunking functions and options. Chunking added to TimeSeries
- Cleanup

v1.0.0
- Added BrowseImage for creating an RGB or single band JPG image from a GeoImage for easy viewing
- Refactored color management (removed class, uses single vector of band names)
- misc fixes
- Added ApplyMask
- Updated swig bindings to properly support numpy arrays as input
- CookieCutter now properly uses cutline

v0.9.9
- Added TimeSeries, Extract, GetRandomPixels, GetPixelClasses functions to GeoImage python bindings
- Standardized datatypes using stdint.h for better interoperability
- 1-d Numpy to CImg conversion fixed

v0.9.8
- Added additional operators on GeoRaster: min, max, exp, sign, acos, etc.
- Added LinearTransform algorithm

v0.9.7
- Added union and transform functions to Rect
- Added additional coordinate convenience functions to GeoData
- Added crop option to CookieCutter

v0.9.6
- Added NDWI and MSAVI2 to Indices function
- Overloaded SetMeta function to take in map<string, string> for multiple items
- Updated algorithms to all take optional metadata dictionary for output
- cleanup of GeoAlgorithms.h and GeoAlgorithms.cpp

v0.9.5
- When opening an image default is now read-only
- Fixed bug with Process to new image
- Added license info to all files
